As a lantern burns the snow
Everything you know
Lantern burns the snow
Everything must go

Nothing ever changes
Everything rearranges
There's a lantern in the snow
What you melt maybe helps you grow

Nothing ever changes
God just rearranges
There's a lantern in the snow
Illuminates and grows

Nothing ever changes
The ocean is just faces
Like a lantern in the snow
What I'm forgetting, what i know

Nothing ever changes
God might rearrange us

Nothing ever changes
But like the sun you rearrange us
And i want to try and grow
I want to feel i know

But nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes

Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes

Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes

Nothing ever changes
Though god my rearrange us

Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes

Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes

Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes

Nothing ever changes
