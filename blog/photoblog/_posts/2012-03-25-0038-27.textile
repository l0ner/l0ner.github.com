Some old photo done using my first camera-equipped cellphone - k750i. Damn, that was a good cellphone. It was so good that I recently bought it's bigger brother k800i.

I did this shot in august 2006, when I first came to Italy. 6 years have passed, so much time...

Best thing is that I haven't touched this photo (except cropping it), it's just like the camera registered it. I think photos like this, the ones that don't reqire any post processing, are the best and they are the ones I'm really satisfied with.
