title: Writing on web

Just a little wonder. Do most people who write or comment something on Internet doesn't know about a fundamental writing rule "One thought, one phrase"? I mean, sometimes i stumble upon comments that look like the author couldn't decide what to write and ended writing everything he had in mind (and those things weren't necessarily related) in one phrase. Usually those comments are incomprehensible and don't have any meaning.

For all those who want to write on the web: You need to remember just three simple rules and it isn't that hard.
# Rule 1: One thought - one phrase. Two thoughts - two phrases. And so on.
# Rule 2: After You finished writing, read what you wrote and ask yourself: "Is this comprehensible?"
# Rule 3: Use"Punctuation":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation. Its not so difficult as it seems and it will help others understanding what you had in mind.

Oh, and one more thing: if you can, verify what are you writing with a dictionary, or spelling checker.
