Today, while reading rss stream form <a href="http://planetkde.org/" target="_blank">planet KDE</a> i stumbled upon a Jaroslaw Staniek's comment about Locus OS. He called it "Failed MS plasma". I became curious so i googled a little. What i found made my astonished.

Apparently whole idea was to build <a href="http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Stream/191676" target="_blank">modular based computer system</a>, where if user needs more power, he buys new modules and attach them to main control unit. But i didn't want to write about this. What I wanted to write about is OS that would be running on this system. After watching video, and some screenshots, i loved it. It would be ideal for mobile PC and NetBooks. Sadly it's only idea that was made for 2008 Microsoft next Gen computer comp made by <a href="http://www.wearetol.com/" target="_blank">Barton Smith</a>. But we have open-source community, why not make something like this (of course after contacting author if we can use his idea). I think it's far better than anything I've seen as NetBook UI.

Below video presentation and some links if You want to read more about it.
