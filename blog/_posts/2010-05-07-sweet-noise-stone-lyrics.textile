I wanna thank you mother
For being with me, ever were you
I wanna thank you for each night and day
For all the things that you told me
I memorized all of them
You used to say be honest,
be good, keep you trusting people
I stepped down to the world
I returned the weaker
And smaller!
I took evil for my being upright
Lies for my truth

Should I be cold as a stone?
Mother!
Should I be cold as a stone?
Mother!

I've got struck from behind
I've thought that it woulde be the last one
Somebody spit right into my face
I thought he wouldn't do it again
When I cried myself blind,
watching the blood flow
They said I was pretending
I opened my heart to my friends
my friends sold my hear

Cold as a stone
I'm getting cold
I'm a stone
Cold as a stone
I'm getting cold
I'm a stone
Cold as a stone
I'm getting cold
I'm a stone
Cold as a stone
Should i be cold
As a stone

I was an open book
Now the book's on fire
My dreams, thoughts
All burnt on the fire
Used to know lot of people
Now I know few
Now I know few!
My frustration became my power
Changed my rage from my pain
Once i had just one face
Now I have two
Now I have two
Each of my faces
Is just as true
Es everything i was
Told by you
One I gave for the world
The other I have just for you
You'll be the one
To see my scars
I'll tell you words the (??????) wouldn't (?????)
Show you
All the places
I had to run to

Mother, tell me!
Mother, tell me!
Mother, tell!
Tell me!

Mother, tell me!
Mother, tell me!
Mother, tell me!
Tell!

Mama tell me
Mama tell me
Should i be cold as a stone
cold as a stone
Should i be cold as a stone!
I'm getting cold
I'm getting cold
As a stone
I'm a stone
Cold as a stone
Cold as a stone
Cold as a stone
Cold as a stone
I
