<!--more-->Thunderstorms. They are so beautiful, so... I don't even know what to write about them. I love them, I love looking at their dangerous beauty. I love their flash of light and then powerful sonic wave.

But i don't love only them. I love the cloudy night sky, reflecting city lights. I love city light themselves.

My favorite kind of photography is the night photography. Maybe because there is so many light in the night. For most people the night is dark and frightening. Maybe because it hides the unknown. I instead love the nights. They are clam, and you can see every small light. Small light shines better within the darkness.

I'm in the middle of creating a photo set called "Lights In The Sky". It will contain photos of thunderstorms, light that only can bee seen at night, city lights reflected in the sky, and so on. For now I've uploaded photos I made until now.
