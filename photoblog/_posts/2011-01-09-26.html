<p style="text-align:center;">Well, I wanted to post some other photo, the more recent one but since I'm lazy and busy I didn't have time to develop it. Actually there's a series of photos that I'd like to post.</p>
Anyway here it is. A new years fireworks I've done in 2009. Shooting fireworks is a bit tricky but if you follow some, well, maybe not rules, but rather tips, you'll get them just fine. <a href="http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Photograph_Fireworks" target="_blank">Here is a bunch of tips</a> I followed and you can see that they turned just right.

Some time later i will post a whole slideshow of fireworks O did this year with my friends. I don't know when though since I will be rather busy.
