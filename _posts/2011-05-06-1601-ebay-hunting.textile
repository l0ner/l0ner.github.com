Just a little note. Every time You want to buy something on e-bay, check if it is available in other country for a lower price, and if it can be shipped to your country and how much it will cost. Sometimes You can get this way item You are searching for for a less money. I forget about this and instead of buying MOBO for my old laptop for something like 30£ in england (33€) i bought it for 90€ in Italy where I live. I paid three times what i would pay in England... shit.
