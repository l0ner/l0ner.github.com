title: The Dandelion Girls - R. T. S. Lowell
---
As home-made candles with fuzzy wicks
Bent birches sprout out of a knob
Where brilliant clouds have surged away -
Clouds are luxuriantly grey.

<!-- more start-->
Slackly curling below this knob
A stagnant brook is stiff with swirls;
By its charred stump three sirens twist
Buttery blooms in their rancid curls.

If wishes were white horses I
Under the sirenic eyes should lie;
Or fluctuate on that charming stream
As a windy wave-walking Christ;

Or as urchin with bare feet,
Birch stick, bent pin and tattered shirt
Flaunting his lanky fishing line
And chub from a opposing bank.

But I dreamt sirens drank me in
As bawdy watchers on the stage
On me harsh birches, nursing dew,
Showered their warm humidity.
