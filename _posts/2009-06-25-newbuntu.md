Nothing to do. I need to wait till Ubuntu 9.04 DVD dowload is finished.
One thing about ubuntu 9.04 that i didn't like when I was using it, was blockade of ctrl+alt+backspace, which normally allow you to restart your -desktop- X server without rebooting whole PC. To enable it you can two things:

~~~~
$sudo apt-get install dontzap
$sudo dontzap --disable
$sudo apt-get remove dontzap
~~~~

Or

~~~~
$sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
~~~~

add:

~~~~
Section “ServerFlags”
Option “DontZap” “false”
EndSection
~~~~

I got those solutions form [http://404.g-net.pl](http://404.g-net.pl/?p=1020)
