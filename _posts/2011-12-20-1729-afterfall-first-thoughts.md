title: Afterfall - first thoughts
---

I've begun playing "Afterfall Insanity". Just a bunch of my opinions after playing it for 10 minutes.

* The camera is too damn close to protagonist
* Whole graphics is too fuzzy. Too much of blur effect for me.
* Audio: I'm playing english version and the actors sound simply unprofessional.
* Leaving Polish names in the english version was a really bad idea.
* Combat: it's pretty annoying that our character can perform only one move. Besides whole system is too stiff.
* Actor play: this is damn unrealistic too. Their movements are just... wrong. Too artificial.
* Every text i heard up until now was really stiff. Unnatural.
* I like idea of the whole shelter being so big that it needs internal railway. This is something I was expecting from fallout vaults and I've never get.
