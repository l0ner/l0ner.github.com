title: Opera + CSS3?
---

Thanks to some guy called [mcv](http://mcv.mulabs.org/) i've stumbled upon 
[this site](http://desandro.com/articles/opera-logo-css/). Practically it 
should display Opera logo made only in CSS3. I checked it and couldn't 
believe what I've seen.

This is how the Opera 10.10 designed it. Same as Internet Explorer. WTF!? I 
turned on my laptop where i have WinXP and newer opera (10.50) and this 
version designed it fine.

So, what the hell is going on here? There isn't much difference in the version 
and yet, it seems that opera 10.10 cannot display CSS3 properly. And the best 
thing is that it pass acid3 test with 100/100 points...

The other thing that i discovered about opera that it uses both Qt and GTK+ 
libraries... I don't have words. I think it's time to change my default web browser.
