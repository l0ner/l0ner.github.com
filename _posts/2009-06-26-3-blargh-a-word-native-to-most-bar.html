A word native to most barbarian's vocabluary, actually originating from the word charge. Due to many ancient warrior's lack of teeth due to many battles and bad oral hygene, it began to come out as "BLLLAAARRRRGHH!!!!" The new battle cry struck fear into the hearts of fows and stuck.
"Your mother is a wench"

"BLLAAAARRRGH!!"

"Ack, my kidney!"

A word. Nothing more needs to be said about this wonderful word. It can be used in times of sadness or anger, and it can be used in times of randomness.
BLARGH!!!
