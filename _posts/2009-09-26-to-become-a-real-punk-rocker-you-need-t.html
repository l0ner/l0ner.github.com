<blockquote>-To become a real Punk Rocker You need to use harsh words like Fuck, Shit, Damn it.
-I, I really don't know how to use such words, what should I do?
-If you don't know, then, to start with, you add 'fuck' or 'fuck off' between words. That's all. Isn't that easy?
-That sure is easy, but, what do they mean...?
-You don't have to worry about that. You just repeat them. They don't have to have a meaning. It's more important to say these words.</blockquote>
Taken from Kira-Kira eroge by mangagamer. I love visual novels.
