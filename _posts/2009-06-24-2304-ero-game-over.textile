"*(Ero)game over man, game over! Pretty much everything in eroge banned*":http://www.japanator.com/elephant/post.phtml?pk=10261

This is going just too far. I'm saying it not as otaku that like that kind of games, but as man who is worshipping liberty of expression. I don't mind banning of all kinky stuff like rape, imprisonment or violence, but not everything. Some people are not doing some of those things only because they can get it in VR, thanks to those games, and 'till they get it in games, they won't do it in RL.
