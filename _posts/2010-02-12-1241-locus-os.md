title: Locus OS
---
Today, while reading rss stream form [planet KDE](http://planetkde.org/) i've
stumbled upon a Jaroslaw Staniek's comment about Locus OS. He called it
"Failed MS plasma". I became curious so i googled a little. What i found made
me astonished.

Apparently whole idea was to build [modular based computer system](http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Stream/191676)
, where if user needs more power, he buys new modules and attach them to main
control unit. But i didn't want to write about this. What I wanted to write
about is OS that would be running on this system. After watching video, and
some screenshots, i loved it. It would be ideal for mobile PC and NetBooks.
Sadly it's only idea that was made for 2008 Microsoft next Gen computer comp
made by [Barton Smith](http://www.wearetol.com/). But we have open-source
community, why not make something like this (of course after contacting author
if we can use his idea). I think it's far better than anything I've seen as
	NetBook UI.

Below video presentation and some links if You want to read more about it.
