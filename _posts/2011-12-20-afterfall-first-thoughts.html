I begun playing "Afterfall Insanity". Just a bunch of my opinions after playing it for 10 minutes.
<ol>
	<li>The camera is too damn close to protagonist</li>
	<li>Whole graphics is too fuzzy. Too much of blur effect for me.</li>
	<li>Audio: I'm playing english version and the actors sound just unprofessional.</li>
	<li>Leaving Polish names in the english version was a really bad idea.</li>
	<li>Combat: it's pretty annoying that our character can perform only one move. Besides whole system is too stiff.</li>
	<li>Actor play: this is damn unrealistic too. Their movements are just... wrong. Too artificial.</li>
	<li>Every text i heard up until now was really stiff. Unnatural.</li>
	<li>I like idea of the whole shelter being so big that it needs internal railway. This is something I was expecting from fallout vaults and I've never get.</li>
</ol>
