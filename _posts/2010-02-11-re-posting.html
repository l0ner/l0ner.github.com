Okay, I've cleaned here a little, changed theme and threw out trash. This blog never was really active, since I stopped to REALLY blog somewhere back in 2008. I didn't want to and didn't have what to write about. Now slowly, slowly (thanks to my blip.pl microblog) I'm beggining to blog again. I stopped to blog in 2008 because of personal reasons, and i kept updated only<a href="http://mindglitch.wordpress.com" target="_blank"> my Photoblog (fully in Polish)</a>, and this place was for me something like a notepad where I could put very random things. And I'll won't stop posting randomness (this blog is a place where i can put my thoughts after all). Maybe I'm not going to post more (but I'll see abut that), but to change my attitude towards this site. Till now as i said it was for me like notebook for my randomness, that i could remember about,Â  pick up, write something, and then again forget it. That's why it was so dusty here...

Update : Oh, i forgot to tell that i deleted all comments to my posts since all of them was marked as spam.
