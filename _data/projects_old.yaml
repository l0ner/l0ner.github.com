  short-desc: Project for my maturity in 2011. Game master assistant
    for a pen&paper RPG game "Neuroshima". Never finished.
  description: A project I did for my maturity in 2011. Game master assistant for a Polish
    pen&paper role playing game called Neuroshima. Aim was to keep track of
    Players main characteristics, modifiers, abilities and inventory.
    Written in C++ and Qt4. Unfinished and abandoned since I don't play Neuroshima
    that much anymore. Note that I didn't know much about objective programming
    in C++ at the time I was writing this, so there are bugs and memory leaks
    everywhere.

  description: Experiment of sorts. Started as tmux-mem-cpu-load fork. I was curious how the
    thing would look using objects. Works, but I'm not going to maintain nor
    develop it further.

  short-desc: Batch Video converter for Sony PSP.
  description: Video converter for Sony PSP. Batch conversions and hardsubbing of ASS (both
    external and ambedded in media file) was my main goals in terms of features.
    Written in Bash and based on mediainfo, mplayer and ffmpeg with aac and x265
    support. Abandoned since I don't travel by bus/train anymore and thus don't
    use my PSP to watch movies.
