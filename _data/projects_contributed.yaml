  short-desc: Simple, lightweight system usage monitor for tmux status line.
  description: <p>A simple, lightweight program provided for system monitoring in 
    the status line of tmux.</p>
    <p>I've did code refactoring that led to version 3.0.0, NetBSD, OpenBSD and           
    FreeBSD ports, some bugfixes and getopt() based argument parsing.</p>
