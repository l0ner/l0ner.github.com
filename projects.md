## Created:

**[bcut](https://github.com/l0ner/bcut){:target="_blank:}**
: A better cut utility.
  I needed a *nix cut utility with ability to count the fields from the end of
  the line. So I wrote it. In Python since I was learning python at the time and
  needed some exercise.

## Contributed to:

**[tmux-mem-cpu-load](https://github.com/thewtex/tmux-mem-cpu-load){:target="_blank"}**
: A simple, lightweight program provided for system monitoring in the status
  line of tmux.

  I've did code refactoring that led to version 3.0.0, NetBSD, OpenBSD and
  FreeBSD ports, some bugfixes and getopt() based argument parsing.

## Old and abandoned:

Projects I have created but I'm not developing/maintaining anymore.

**[sysstat](https://github.com/l0ner/sysstat){:target="_blank"}
: Experiment of sorts. Started as tmux-mem-cpu-load fork. I was curious how the
  thing would look using objects. Works, but I'm not going to maintain nor
  develop it further.

**[video4psp](https://github.com/l0ner/video4psp){:target="_blank"}
: Video converter for Sony PSP. Batch conversions and hardsubbing of ASS (both
  external and ambedded in media file) was my main goals in terms of features.
  Written in Bash and based on mediainfo, mplayer and ffmpeg with aac and x265
  support. Abandoned since I don't travel by bus/train anymore and thus don't
  use my PSP to watch movies.

**[neurohelper](httpsL//github.com/l0ner/neurohelper){:target="_blank"}
: A project I did for my maturity in 2011: Game master assistant for a Polish
  pen&paper role playing game called Neuroshima. Aim was to keep track of
  Players main characteristics, modifiers, abilities and inventory.
  Written in C++ and Qt4. Unfinished and abandoned since I don't play Neuroshima
  that much anymore. Note that I didn't know much about objective programming
  in C++ at the time I was writing this, so there are bugs and memory leaks
  everywhere.
